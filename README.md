# Predict the Housing Prices in Ames
This project is for the Practical Statistical Learning course at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. In this project, students are given 10 splits of training and test data for the houses sold in Ames, Iowa, and tasked to predict their sales prices, with both a linear model using regularization, and a tree model. The goal of this project is to minimize the RMSE of the logarithm of the sales prices between the predictions and the actual results.
