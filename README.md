# Predict the Housing Prices in Ames
This project is for the Practical Statistical Learning course at the University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign. In this project, students are given 10 splits of training and test data for the houses in Ames, Iowa, and tasked to predict their sales prices, with both a linear model using regularization, and a tree model. The goal is to minimize the RMSE of the logarithm of the sales price between the predictions and the actual results.
